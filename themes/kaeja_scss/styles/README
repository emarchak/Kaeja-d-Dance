##### Sasson - advanced drupal theming. #####

This is the directory for all your style sheets,
By default it contains a .scss file and a .css file, both of them are already called from your .info file.
This is where sass will look for partials, so they should reside here, preferably in the partials folder.
You may add an RTL version or an LTR version for both of them using filename-rtl.css or filename-rtl.scss etc.
if you add a new style sheet here, you must call it from the theme .info file.
